## Founder History

Modons was born from the desire to make technology secure and accessible for everyone. During the pandemic in 2020, much of the world was forced online and the demand for computer assistance skyrocketed. After receiving many questions and concerns regarding the security of their digital lives, our customers suggested we provide organized services to help. Since then, we have had years of success and finally decided to make it official with the birth of Modons.com!

## Mission

With services ranging from personal identity security to startup IT and security infrastructure bootstrapping, our services provide the peace of mind that the digital life of your person and company are correctly taken care of to suit your needs.
